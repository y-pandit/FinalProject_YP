# Virtual Chemistry Lab- An SVG.js Project

## Problem Statement: 
Children across the world need to gain knowledge about the basic chemistry experiments and reactions that occur as a result of those experiments.   
The theory about the experiments is taught and included in curriculums all around the world.   
However, the facilities to practically perform the experiments for children to see and observe the results of the experiments aren’t available everywhere in the world.   
Therefore, the practical study that is prescribed in the curriculum is hard to accomplish and certain students miss out on that experience.   
There must be a solution that allows students without laboratory equipment but with computer access to practice basic chemistry experiments.  

## The Solution: 
With the spread of internet and computers all around the globe, it might be possible to remedy the problem of practical performance by allowing children to conduct the experiments in a virtual environment or a laboratory with all virtual equipment and materials necessary for experimentation.  
This will allow children to practice their theoretical chemistry knowledge with the aid of the software.   
This will also help in overcoming the limitation of laboratory access and equipment and allow students to be more independent when it comes to gaining practical knowledge.

### General App Flow:
The user is lead to a virtual laboratory
setup.  
•	It contains a functional apparatus cupboard, a timer to time the experiment and a blackboard that explains the steps.  
•	There is a platform for the user to experiment on.  
•	The user must follow the steps to accurately see the experiment results.  
•	The application background music plays. This is implemented using the HTML5 <audio> tag.
